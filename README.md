# app-positions (standalone)

Minimal Vue 3 app that renders **"Positions app"**. This version is **standalone** and does **not** use `@y2kfund/core`.

## Scripts
```bash
pnpm install   # or npm install / yarn
pnpm dev       # start dev server (http://localhost:5101)
pnpm build     # production build
pnpm preview   # preview built app
```

## Notes
- Pure Vue 3 + Vite.
- No Supabase / TanStack Query / app-core hereâ€”just a simple starter.
- Upgrade to your full architecture later by replacing this with the library build + core plugin.
